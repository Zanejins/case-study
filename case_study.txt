The main function of the sun search control software is to perform sun acquisition by collecting measurement data from gyroscopes and sun sensors to determine the current attitude of the satellite, and then control the satellite to rotate around the pitch or roll axis so that the sun sensor can detect the sun and maintain the spacecraft's sun-pointing attitude.
The software can receive ground commands through a serial port, perform command verification, and set the satellite's operating mode word.
The control software sends a two-byte data acquisition command to the gyroscope through a serial port in each cycle, and then receives the gyroscope measurement data through another serial port. The serial port addresses used for sending and receiving commands are both 0x881.
The angle measurement data is obtained by analog-to-digital conversion of the angle analog signal, which is a 12-bit measurement (offset binary code, range 0x000~0xFFF). The minimum code corresponds to 5/2048. The software collects the SP signal and the tuning element state signal through a stored circuit.
The power status signal is collected by AD conversion. When powered on, the software sends a gyroscope home appliance command (0xEB92) through a serial port, and then sends a gyroscope control command through another serial port with address 0x881A. The interval between each byte sent is less than 5us.
The sun sensor switching instruction is 190ms, with a positive pulse of 1ms. The software controls the pulse output by writing the enable signal to the controller, as shown in the table below.
The sun search software controller consists of gyroscopes, sun sensors, three-axis control thrusters, and a data management computer. There are four sun sensors and nine gyroscopes in total.
The system needs to use a data management computer to receive ground operator commands for packaging telemetry data and sending telemetry commands.
The system needs to use gyroscopes to monitor the satellite's three-axis angular velocity in order to obtain the angular velocity analog signal.
The system needs to use sun sensors to monitor the sun's position in order to obtain the sun measurement angle and perceive the sun visible flag.
The system needs to use three-axis control thrusters to control the three-axis torque in order to drive the satellite to rotate.
The system needs to use a mode register to store the current operating mode word, the current mode duration, the target angle, and the target angular velocity in order to control the operating mode.
The main function of the sun search control software is to capture the sun, determine the current attitude of the satellite by collecting the measurement data of the gyroscope and the sun sensor, and then control the rotation of the satellite around the pitch or roll axis so that the sun sensor can find the sun and keep the star on the sun Orientation gesture.
The whole search process is divided into four stages: rate damping RDSM, pitching search PASM, rolling search RASM and sun cruise CSM.
The functions of the four stages are as follows: Rate damping: reduce the angular velocity of the three-axis rotation of the star to maintain a stable attitude; pitch search: control the star to rotate along the pitch axis to search for the sun at a certain angular velocity; roll search: control the star to rotate along the roll axis at a certain angular velocity Searching for the sun; cruising towards the sun: After searching for the sun, keep a stable attitude and keep tracking the sun.
The satellite is composed of several subsystems, and the control system is the subsystem with the most functions and the most complex processing logic.
The composition of the control system is as follows:
1) Sensor (Sensor): 4 sun sensors (main and backup), 9 gyroscopes.
2) Actuator: 12 10N thrusters, of which 2A/2B, 3A/3B provide the attitude control torque of the roll axis, 4A/4B, 5A/5B provide the attitude control torque of the pitch axis, 6A/6B, 7A/ 7B provides yaw axis control torque.
3) Controller (Controller): The control computer CPU uses 80C32, PROM32K bytes, and SRAM8K bytes.
The system composition is shown in the figure below.
The control software runs in the mode of main program plus interruption, the main program is an infinite loop, and the interruption is 32 milliseconds regular cycle interruption.
Their functions are as follows:
(1) Main program function: first, initialize the variables and power on the sensors (gyroscope, sun sensor) and actuator (thruster), start the 32ms timer interrupt, and then execute the 160ms cycle control task (every cycle completes the sensor Measurement data acquisition, remote control and telemetry processing, mode management, control quantity calculation, thruster allocation calculation, fault diagnosis and processing, etc.).
(2) 32ms interrupt service program function: the control computer generates an interrupt every 32ms, enters the interrupt service program, performs interrupt counting in the interrupt service program, and generates a 160ms control cycle for five 32ms interrupts.
At the 128th ms of each 160ms control cycle, the switch data of 12 10N thrusters will be sequentially output (the system needs to output the jet at a certain time).
The control computer takes the microcontroller 80C32E as the core, the main frequency is 11.0592MHZ, including 32KB of PROM and 8KB of SRAM.
Only one interrupt is processed in the sun search control software, that is, the 32ms timer interrupt.
When the software is initialized, the timer can be started to generate a continuous 32ms timer interrupt signal by writing a '1' to the D[0] bit of the timing control register GTCR0.
The address of register GTCR0 is 0x8083.
The allocation of memory addresses is as follows.
